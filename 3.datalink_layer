1.What is data link layer?
Data Link Layer is second layer of OSI Layered Model. Data link layer is responsible for converting data stream to signals bit by bit and to send that over the underlying hardware.

2.Functions of data link layer
1.framing
2.addressing
3.synchronization
4.error control
5.flow control 
6.multi-access

3.Tyes of errors
single bit error:In a frame, there is only one bit, anywhere though, which is corrupt.
Multiple bits error:Frame is received with more than one bits in corrupted state.
Burst error:Frame contains more than1 consecutive bits corrupted.

4.What are the error control mechanism?
1.error detection
2.error correction

5. Explain sliding window
Sliding window refers to an imaginary boxes that hold the frames on both sender and receiver side.
• It provides the upper limit on the number of frames that can be transmitted before requiring an acknowledgment.
• Frames may be acknowledged by receiver at any point even when window is not full on receiver side.
• Frames may be transmitted by source even when window is not yet full on sender side.
• The windows have a specific size in which the frames are numbered modulo- n, which means they are numbered from 0 to n-l. 
For e.g. if n = 8, the frames are numbered 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7, 0, 1,2,3,4,5,6, 7, 0, 1, ....
• The size of window is n-1. For e.g. In this case it is 7. Therefore, a maximum of n-l frames may be sent before an acknowledgment.
• When the receiver sends an ACK, it includes the number of next frame it expects to receive. For example in order to acknowledge the 
group of frames ending in frame 4, the receiver sends an ACK containing the number 5. When sender sees an ACK with number 5, it comes to
know that all the frames up to number 4 have been received.
